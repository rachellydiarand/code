The js music player in conjunction with the php fileIterator is an excellent playlist tool for mp3 files.

The cs Bee Log Utility has my picture viewer app and camera included in the solution.  It's about a 10MB download.  I added the php to html compiler to it a few weeks ago and it's working well.  You can use the file copy section on the lower right of the tool to move images to the html compile folder.  It does not overwrite old images.  The Bee Log Utility has image tools to resize pictures and wrap and anchor link around them to the original large size image.  The Open Image button opens your default image program, but you can make the moth picture viewer your default program and I'm certainly doing that.

Crop selection and copy is a simple right mouse drag.  Upon release, it's copied to the clipboard.  Then click the Paste menu button to paste it into a new moth picture viewer.

There is some incompleteness here and some disorganized code.  I've been doing a million things around here with no help at all.  Let me know if you clean things up!  Have at it!
